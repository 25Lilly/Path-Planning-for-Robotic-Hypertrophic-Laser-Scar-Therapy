# Path-Planning-for-Robotic-Hypertrophic-Laser-Scar-Therapy
This repository conatains the code and images meant for training a laser agent. It was an educational tool to allow us to self-explore robot learning. 

# Features
- U-Net Segmentation
- Lumped Capacitance Heat Model
- Q-Learning Path Planning

# Tools
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Tools / Libraries

# Instructions to Run
Easiest Way to Run: Open this file in Google Co-Lab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zEf3eBp5WqS_NX71rrh3yA-GYFOHjtIv#scrollTo=vkLOVCatmmMY

Download both the Segmentation and Images folders. 
Start the runtime (reccomendation Python3, T4 GPU).
Import both folders into the files section of the Co-Lab runtime

Press Run All
