# Path-Planning-for-Robotic-Hypertrophic-Laser-Scar-Therapy
This repository conatains the code and images meant for training a laser agent used in a simulated hypertrophic scar therapy procedure. An image of a hypertrophic scar is segmented, post-processed into an array of laser-applicable squares, and given a path for an ideal laser therapy procedure.
