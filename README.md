# Instructions to Run
Run Online (Recommended Method): 
Open this file in Google Co-Lab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zEf3eBp5WqS_NX71rrh3yA-GYFOHjtIv#scrollTo=vkLOVCatmmMY

Download both the Segmentation and Images folders.  
Start the runtime (recommendation Python3, T4 GPU).  
Import both folders into the files section of the Co-Lab runtime.   
Press Run All.

Run Locally:  
Download the .ipynb file, segmenetation folder, and images folder.   
Download all required libraries.  
Run code.
